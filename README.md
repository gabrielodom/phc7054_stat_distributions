# PHC 7054 Advanced Biostatistics III: Statistical Distributions
These are the course notes for the third semester of theoretical biostatistics, as currently taught by Prof. Gabriel Odom at Florida International University. Exercises and literature review created by my students, Nusrat Yasmin, <>, and <>. The "work in progress" version of the textbook is published here: <https://gabriel.quarto.pub/stat-distributions-primer/>.

I use the package `rUM` to help me create the chapter skeletons in the subdirectory `chapters/` with this code:
```
rUM::write_quarto("bernoulli_20250310", path = "chapters/")
```
