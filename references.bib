	abstract = {This paper concerns the regression analysis of discrete time survival data for heterogeneous populations by means of frailty models. We express the survival time for each individual as a sequence of binary variables that indicate if the individual survived at each time point. The main result is that the likelihood for these indicators can be factored into contributions that involve the conditional survival probabilities integrated over the frailty distribution of the risk set (population-averaged). We then model these population-averaged conditional probabilities as a function of covariates. The result justifies the practice of treating the failure indicators as independent Bernoulli trials and fitting binary regression models for the conditional failure probabilities at each time point. However, we must interpret the regression coefficients as population-averaged rather than subject-specific parameters. We apply the method to the Framingham Heart Study on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD), alternatively known as cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in the world. Accordingly, a plethora of research have been conducted to predict the early diagnosis of the heart disease and determine the most important risk factors associated with the disease. Despite these considerable efforts, the accuracy of the prediction has remained inadequate and the most important risk factors have remained elusive. This research paper discusses many risk factors associated with the disease and presents the prediction models of coronary heart disease using supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms. It uses the public dataset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of coronary heart disease patients. The results show that the Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms have accuracies of 85.00\%, 85.00\% and 75.00\%, respectively. Moreover, the precision, F-measure and recall of the Gaussian and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes are higher than those of Random Forest algorithm, signifying its importance in predicting the early diagnosis of the disease.},

	abstract = {The success of the first edition of Generalized Linear Models led to the updated Second Edition, which continues to provide a definitive unified, treatment of methods for the analysis of diverse types of data. Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications.The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

Wilson's suggestion of inverting the related score test with null rather than estimated standard error yields coverage probabilities close to nominal confidence levels, even for very small sample sizes. The 95\% score interval has similar behavior as the adjusted Wald interval obtained after adding two “successes” and two “failures” to the sample. In elementary courses, with the score and adjusted Wald methods it is unnecessary to provide students with awkward sample size guidelines.},

We consider the general case where they differ across units and show how to perform randomization tests and obtain point estimates and confidence intervals. Furthermore, we develop rejection-sampling and importance-sampling approaches for conducting randomization-based inference conditional on any statistic of interest, such as the number of treated units or forms of covariate balance. We establish that our randomization tests are valid tests, and through simulation we demonstrate how the rejection-sampling and importance-sampling approaches can yield powerful randomization tests and thus precise inference. Our work also has implications for observational studies, which commonly assume a strongly ignorable assignment mechanism. Most methodologies for observational studies make additional modeling or asymptotic assumptions, while our framework only assumes the strongly ignorable assignment mechanism, and thus can be considered a minimal-assumption approach.},

	abstract = {Objective
Tuberculosis is a major public health problem and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. BCG vaccination is a life-saving and important part of standard tuberculosis control measures, particularly in Ethiopia where tuberculosis is endemic. The End Tuberculosis Strategy targets of 2020 have not been achieved. Exploring spatial variations in BCG vaccination among children is vital to designing and monitoring effective intervention programmes. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the spatial variation in BCG vaccination among children in Ethiopia.

Design
Cross-sectional study design.

Setting
Ethiopia.

Participants
Children aged 0–35 months.

Primary outcome
BCG vaccination coverage.

Methods
Data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey were used and a total of 4453 children aged 0–35 months were included. Spatial autocorrelation analysis, cluster and outlier analysis, hotspot analysis, spatial interpolation, and spatial scan statistics were carried out to identify geographical risk areas for BCG vaccine utilisation. ArcGIS V.10.6 and SaTScan V.9.6 statistical software were employed to explore spatial pattern and significant hotspot areas for BCG vaccination among children.

Results
BCG vaccination was spatially clustered in Ethiopia at the regional level (Global Moran’s I=0.516, p{\textless}0.001). A total of 51 most likely clusters of low BCG vaccination were identified in the Somali and Afar regions (log-likelihood ratio=136.58, p{\textless}0.001). Significant secondary clusters were also identified in North West Gambela, South Amhara, South West Addis Ababa, North East Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region, and South West Oromia.

Conclusion
A low probability of receiving BCG vaccination was found among children in the Somali and Afar regions. Therefore, these areas should be given attention when designing effective immunisation strategies to improve BCG vaccination among children in order to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in Ethiopia.},

This option is quite logical because perception of sensitive (insensitive) inquiry can vary among respondents. The properties of the proposed method are discussed and compared with existing randomized response techniques. Cost analysis is also carried out to prove supremacy of the suggested method.
