This is a collection of notes about deriving basic properties of statistical distributions. I tried to write it so that a student who has had 2-3 semesters of undergraduate calculus can understand. It's not deeply theoretical, but it does include theory.

There are probably mistakes in derivations and typos in formulas. As with anything you find on the internet, buyer beware. This is a free website, so--as the old saying goes--"you get what you pay for".
