# PHC 7054 Advanced Biostatistics III: Statistical Distributions
These are the course notes for the third semester of theoretical biostatistics, as currently taught by Prof. Gabriel Odom at Florida International University.

I use the package `rUM` to help me create the chapter skeletons in the subdirectory `chapters/` with this code:
```
rUM::write_quarto("bernoulli_20250310", path = "chapters/")
```
